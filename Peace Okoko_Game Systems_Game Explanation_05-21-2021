    The game I created is currently called Press and Play. The concept of my
    game was inspired by the game Flappy Bird. Flappy Bird was a mobile game
    released on May 24, 2013. The game instantly became a hit, with downloads
    reaching 50 million less than a year after its release. Almost everyone at
    my high school had downloaded flappy bird, and there was a battle to reach
    the highest score all over my high school. I remember my classmates
    obsessively playing Flappy Bird. YouTube videos that explained how to get
    high scores on Flappy Bird grew in popularity as the demand to beat the
    game continued. However, as quickly as Flappy Bird reached the heights of
    its success, its popularity began to decline. People began to see how
    addictive the game was and the detriments of the game became more apparent.
    The creator of Flappy Bird, Dong Nguyen, took the game off the app store in
    2014 after realizing how addictive the game was. Nguyen said, “Flappy Bird
    was designed to play for a few minutes when you are relaxed… but it happens
    to become an addictive product. I think it has a problem. To solve that
    problem, it is best to take down Flappy Bird. It’s gone forever” (“Here is
    the Real Reason Flappy Bird was removed”, 2014). At the time Nguyen was
    making $50,000 a day from ads aired on the game. However, he still chose to
    delete the app from the guilt he felt.

    <strong>Why was it so addictive?</strong>
    <strong> </strong>

    The game featured a duck surrounded by a background of poles. The main goal
    of the game was to tap the screen as fast as possible so that the duck
    would not fall into the pipes or bump into anything. In Flappy Bird, being
    close to a pipe would mean the user had to restart the game. The maze
    created by the appearance of the pipes in Flappy Bird was endless. Even
    after a user beat their high score, there was no gratification because the
    game was so monotonous. The monotonous aspect of the game kept users
    playing because there was no change in scenery/background to track the
    users’ progress through. Everything stayed the same but every time the user
    started a new game they were uncertain as to whether they would even make
    it past the first pipe without dying. The frustration many people had when
    playing the game found its way to social media. The more people saw the
    game being praised on social media, the more users and popularity the game
    gained. It was like people enjoyed having a community where they could vent
    their frustrations to and brag about their high scores.

    <strong>Aspects of Flappy Bird </strong>
    <strong>Game I'm Keeping:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When creating my game I wanted to focus on the nostalgic aspect of the
    game. My background is the same color as the Flappy Bird background. I
    think the color creates a calming mood that the user can easily get lost
    in. The higher levels of my game have the green blocks on them to emulate
    the pipes in Flappy Bird. My game is also a jumping game where users
    primarily have to press the up button to get any substantial movement. The
    jumping is similar to that in Flappy Bird where the user has to have one
    key pressed for a while to sustain movement. I implemented gravity in the
    game in the same way it is done in Flappy Bird. The gravity pushes the user
    down suddenly when they stop holding the up-arrow key. This forces the user
    to constantly be on their toes and think of the moves they make ahead of
    time.

    <strong>Concept</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The initial concept of my game was creating an adventure game where my
    little cousin would feel seen and represented. There are not a lot of games
    with black characters on the market right now. Games with black femme
    characters can be counted on one hand. My cousin plays a lot of video
    games, and I wanted her to get a chance to see herself in the game. At
    first, I wanted my game to be a hair tutorial where the user collects
    products and then hair styles created from the collection of products would
    be displayed. In this initial version of the game the user would start out
    with no hair and then collect products and the hair style would be
    displayed at the end. However, I soon realized this would not be the best
    message to send to my cousin and I wanted every hairstyle to have equal
    representation and for there not to be a goal to aspire to. So I decided to
    create an adventure-like game where the user goes through all the flat
    blocks and collects a certain number of products to move on to the next
    level.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sprites:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I have a set of 5 different sprites. Each of my sprite characters are
    called person. Each set has its own outfit and range of motions. My initial
    idea was to rotate through each of the sprite characters and have them
    change their representation once a button for motion was pressed. If the
    right arrow key was pressed for example, I wanted the sprite being
    displayed to have their feet going in that direction. However, I had a lot
    of trouble figuring out a function that would cycle through each of the
    sprites when a specific motion was warranted. Instead of having the sprites
    circle around I just had one sprite set as the sprite for the whole game.
    In addition to this, I created sprites for each of the natural hair
    products that needed to be collected by the user in order to win the game.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Music:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I wanted the music to set the scene for the game. The song that kept
    replaying in my head while I was doing the code for the game was, “Lost in
    the World” by Kanye West. I think it works with the concept of the game
    because the character has to find the products in an unknown world. The
    music plays throughout the whole game until the user loses. I was in the
    middle of coding the losing song into the game but it was causing a glitch
    in my code and I decided against it. Eventually I would like to add a song
    for a win and a loss.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Map:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The map is directly influenced by the aspects of Flappy Bird. The blue
    background color and blocks are supposed to borrow from the Flappy Bird
    game. I was also inspired by African print patterns when I was designing
    the blocks. Each tile/block has its own distinct design.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Improvements/Future:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I still have a lot of glitches that need to be solved. The first is the
    bottom right collision. I also have to fix the level transitions so that
    the user can move from one level to another seamlessly.
